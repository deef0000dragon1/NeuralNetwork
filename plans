how to compare the different genomes

look for operatons that have the same random code, look at their inputs, compare.

look for common linkages. 

look for operations that have the same inputs but different operations. 





//to be added in the system creating the genomes
//system that looks at teh genome and randomly adds or changes parts of the genome. 
//each of the additions has to be checked. 
//check that all nodes have atleast one node that is attached to it's input. 


Write the 

LinkedList<E> subList(int first, int last) 

method for a linked list that returns a sublist of items 
(you can use a single linked list form for simplicity).
Assume a method 
Node<E> goTo(int position) 
that returns the node at that position; 
also assume method 
void checkIndex(int index) 
that throws an exception for out of bounds index values.
